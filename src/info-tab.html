      <ul>
        <li>You can change quest codes without letting users complete the quest again.</li>
        <li>If you re-order quests, users that have already completed a quest that they now cannot access will still have completed the quest.</li>
        <li>You can technically have multiple quests with the same completion code, but this will be confusing to both you and your users and is not recommended.</li>

  <h3 class="title">Levels</h3>
  <p>When users gain enough XP to get a level, the level up message will be sent. If you change how much XP users need to achieve a level, players levels will change to reflect the new requirement. Each level's XP field is how much XP is required to level up from the previous level.</p>
